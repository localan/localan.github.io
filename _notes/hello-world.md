This is a sample note published from the `_notes` collection.

- Write notes in Obsidian as usual
- Keep public notes inside the `_notes/` folder in this repo
- Push to GitHub — Pages renders them at `/notes/`

You can use standard Markdown — headings, lists, code blocks, and more:

```bash
echo "Philoshi Hacker"
```

Internal links between notes also work if you link by filename:

- See [[hello-world]] (self-link)
